Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è
IMPORTANT
First of all, you need to create an api key using Cohere's TRIAL KEYS.
After you've created your account, visit this page to view your Key. under the "Trial keys" section, there should be a key under the name "default". next to it, click on the eye üëÅÔ∏è icon to view your key. copy this for later.
Now, install the latest release to github.
After extracting this to a folder, navigate to line 70 of content.js where you can input your API key, withi the parameter that says "KEY-HERE". for example, it would later look like:
(lines 69 - 72)

  async function queryCohere(question, options, context) {
    const apiKey = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP';
    const response = await fetch('https://api.cohere.ai/generate', {
        method: 'POST',
Easy Section
After you've completed that step, you're ready to move onto the easy part.

For each browser, you'll need to visit your extensions page. this hyperlink leads to the chrome one, but you'll need to navigate to your browser's designated one, for example edge://extensions.

It will then open a file explorer window, in which you need to navigate to the folder that you've stored the extension in (the same place that content.js will be located).

After you've completed those steps, this extension should pop up. Image
